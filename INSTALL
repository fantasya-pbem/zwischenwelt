         Installing Zwischenwelt
====================================================
ok, sorry for this bad installation documentation and
the general lack of any documentation. maybe more next
release. Under http://zwischenwelt.org/wiki/ you can
get information (mostly german) and http://zwischenwelt.org/forum/
is also a good place to get help (mostly german, but
postings in english are wellcome).

==[ requirements ]==
*Webserver (ie. Apache) with PHP4 support
*MySql 4.0
*some space on the harddisc
*good internet connection

==[ installation ]==
-put all this code somewhere in your wwwroot
-import db.sql (it contains a minimum db dump)
 with the admin user and the newbie guild "weltbank"
-rename the defines.mysql.php.dist to defines.mysql.php
 and change the basic settings like db access or gfx path
-create a directory "tmp" in the BASEPATH of the game where the
 webserver can write files (chmod 777 tmp)
-set admin user password with this query: UPDATE `user` SET `pass`=PASSWORD("your-admin-password")
-login with username Admin and your password an start creating the game
-adjust pwvergessen.php and anmelden.php (ie. mail)
-open your webbrowser and register an account (php needs to send a mail) for creating a normal
 player account

if this does not work find the error and tell us :) that we can add the fix into
the next relase. so have fun with this.

cron.php needs to be called every minute. You can use the script runcron.sh to do this (this works like
a very stupid daemon process).
